## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I made the attempt twice, because the first time I thought I was being smart and was using flexbox in places I shouldn't have been using flexbox. When the different divs started overlapping, it was at that moment I knew I screwed up. Turns out, the one thing that needed to be changed was adding some padding to the card class and it was smooth sailing from there.
Made a little simple extra hover animation as well where the cover pops up.

### Useful resources

- [Reddit lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/pftjfb/how_to_smoothly_transition_from_a_hover_to_a_non/) - Helped me figure out how to smooth a transition out between the initial state to hover and then back to initial state.
